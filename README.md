## 👋 Hi there! I'm Bagas Dwi Rachmad Roziqin

🔭 I’m currently working on:  
Building Android apps and experimenting with real-time hand tracking using Python and OpenCV.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
Open-source projects related to computer vision, mobile development (React Native), or cybersecurity.

🤝 I’m looking for help with:  
Improving model accuracy in hand gesture recognition and efficient mobile UI/UX design.

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- Deep Learning for vision tasks  
- System-level programming in Linux  
- Firebase integration with React Native

💬 Ask me about:  
- React Native & TypeScript  
- Clean architecture and modular code  
- Ethical hacking basics and wireless network security  
- How to debug weird phone issues 😅

⚡ Fun fact:  
I once tried to write on screen using just my hand movements detected by a webcam. It kinda worked... for the letter "O" at least!
